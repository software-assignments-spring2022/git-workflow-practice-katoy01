### "Workers at an Activision game studio say they are forming a union."

# Thoughts
I find this article interesting because it's _insane_ think about how there have been no unions in the game industry in the U.S. until December 2021!
```
"In contrast to Europe, unions are rare in the North American gaming
industry. American employees are often subjected to unexpected layoffs and
brutal “crunch,” in which they are required to work long hours and weekends
for weeks at a time to ensure games do not miss deadlines.
...
In December, workers at the independent game developer Vodeo Games, which
has about a dozen employees, became the first video game studio union in
North America."
```
And gaming companies are notorious for terrible "bro-culture" working
environemnts, so to speak, where many sexual assault victims have stood up
in the wake of the Me Too movement in the past couple years. Most notibally
in Riot Games and Activision Blizzard. 
```
"Activision, which Microsoft on Tuesday said it would buy for nearly $70
billion, has been dealing with months of employee unrest. Before the
company incited anger by not keeping the Raven workers in December,
employees had been pushing for labor organizing and better treatment since
July, when a California employment agency sued Activision, accusing it of
fostering a culture where women were routinely sexually harassed and
discriminated against."
```
Having an improved work place is probably a topic any aspiring software developer, which many of the students in this class are, is interested in, and this movement in Activision could spark a new standard of living for software developers going into the gaming industry. If unions become accepted and popularized, there could be hope of having healthy working hours and improved pay that could ease the pain of living in this post-capitalist world. Or that could be too optimistic and either unions do absolutely nothing to improve the work environment, or unionizing loses traction entirely. I'm just hoping that working as a software developer and being happy aren't mutually exclusive, and that it's not all doomed from the start.
